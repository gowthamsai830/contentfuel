# Content Fuel Micro-Copy Brand Guide

## Overview
This guide provides soft, subtle micro-copy lines that reinforce Content Fuel's ownership by Brand Origin while maintaining a Gen-Z, creative, and startup-like aesthetic. The copy is intentionally human, modern, and avoids corporate language.

- **Light weight** (300-400)
- **Muted color** (foreground/50-60%)
- **Subtle spacing** (tight, minimal breathing room)
- **Non-intrusive** (feels like a whisper, not a shout)

1. **"from brand origin"** ← *Recommended for primary use*
   - Direct, clear, minimal
   - Establishes ownership without ego
   - Works in any context

## 2. BOLDER GEN-Z LINES (3 Options)

These are for emphasis moments, secondary headers, or accent copy. They should be:
- **Slightly bolder** (500-600 weight)

- **Still lowercase** (maintains consistency)
- **Can use color accent** (primary color at 70-80% opacity)

- **Muted color** (foreground/40-50%)

## TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES

✓ **DO:**
- Keep it lowercase (modern, approachable)
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid corporate jargon
- Feel human and authentic
- Maintain Gen-Z sensibility
- Show personality without being try-hard

✗ **DON'T:**
- Use ALL CAPS (too aggressive)
- Add emojis (unless specifically requested)
- Use corporate phrases ("proudly presents", "a division of")
- Make it about ego (Brand Origin doesn't need to shout)
- Repeat exact same copy in header and footer
- Use overly trendy slang (will age poorly)

---

## RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Header: Keep micro-copy visible but may need to reduce font size to 0.65rem
- Consider hiding on very small screens if space is tight
- Maintain readability above all else

### Tablet (768px - 1024px)
- Header: Standard sizing applies
- Footer: Standard sizing applies

### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Header: Full sizing, can be slightly more prominent
- Footer: Full sizing with generous spacing

---

## ACCESSIBILITY NOTES

- Ensure sufficient contrast: `text-foreground/55` on light backgrounds, `text-foreground/45` on dark
- Use semantic HTML (`<small>` or `<span>` with appropriate ARIA labels if needed)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Maintain readable font size (minimum 10px for body text)
- Test with screen readers to ensure copy is announced appropriately

---

## FUTURE VARIATIONS

As the brand evolves, consider these alternative approaches:

1. **Seasonal Variations**: Rotate micro-copy quarterly
2. **Campaign-Specific**: Change based on current initiatives
3. **Contextual**: Different copy for different pages
4. **Interactive**: Hover states that reveal additional copy
